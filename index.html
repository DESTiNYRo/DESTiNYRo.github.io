      <p class = "petition">We tend to believe that we as humans, social creatures, can go through many traumatic events and bounce back. There are only so many hardships even the stringest person can take until we breakdown. We don't need to go through these events alone. It is okay to ask for help. Seeing the dangers of trying to work on yourself alone should be an alarm, a wake-up call for you to reach out. Getting better with the encouragement of your peers can keep you motivated and speed up the process. You are not alone. Join us to bring awareness to this fact, and bring people together
