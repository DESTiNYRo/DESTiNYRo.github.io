Hello all! 
I would liked to introduce my Better Yourself website 

Through Codepath Intro to Web Dev 101 course I took in the fall of 2023, I was able to create a starter website.

It's purpose is to help those who carry self doubt and mental health issues. It shows different way they focus on a issue they have to improve themselves.

This is not the final product.
I would like to document the growth of it and the changes I make along the way.

Enjoy.
